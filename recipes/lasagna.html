<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagne originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. The oldest transcribed text about lasagne appears in 1282 in the Memoriali Bolognesi ("Bolognesi Memorials"), in which lasagne was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary;[4][5] while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery).[6] It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagne, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets (lasagne), boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick.[7] Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.</p>
<p>Lasagne al forno, layered with a thicker ragù and Béchamel sauce and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, are traditionally associated with the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Here, and especially in its capital, Bologna, layers of lasagne are traditionally green (the color is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables into the dough)[9] and served with ragù (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes), bechamel and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1/4 cup margarine</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable broth (as needed)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white wine</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup light ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 egg white</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>2 cups coarsely shredded carrots</li>
    <li>2 cups coarsely chopped zucchini</li>
    <li>1 (10 ounce) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
    <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
    <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
