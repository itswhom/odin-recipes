<h2>Description</h2>
<p>You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it, I truly believe you will never go back to the traditionally 'boiled' beef. This recipe was given to my mother-in-law during WWII by her Jewish boarding house owner and it has become a treasured family recipe. Unlike the commonly boiled corned beef, this is a slow braise that is tender, flavorful, and has a caramelized surface when it's done. I serve it with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips. It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year around.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (5 pound) flat-cut corned beef brisket</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon browning sauce (as desired)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef. Brush brisket with browning sauce on both sides. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil, 5 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Place brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter onion and garlic slices over brisket and add water to roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven until meat is tender, about 6 hours.</li>
</ol>
